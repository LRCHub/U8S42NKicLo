Caught a look in your eyes
I'd they linger too long
Were you just being kind
Or have a read it all wrong
When i brushed by your side

Bridge 1
Suddenly I realised
There's something going on

Chorus
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
Whatever it is
Whatever you do
I'm falling for you

I must gain control
I must take care
Can't allow this to ever
Become an affair
But the tension is sweet

Bridge 2
Suddenly I need it
To keep this going on

All night I think of nothing else
(But if) I could sit out this storm
I'd try, to forget how I felt
(But as) soon as I see your face
I know I'll fall

And every moment
I have to endure
I look for a reasion
To be where you are
I'm out of my head

Suddenly I realise
You are where I belong

Gonna kill this thing
Forever
We can't carry on
Whatever it is
What ever you do I'm falling for you
