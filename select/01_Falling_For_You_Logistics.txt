Waking up at 7: 30
Just to see your pretty sleepy face
I went down to make some coffee
To share with you my dear

And here at last the sun is shining
And I can see you smiling

And from every word you say
You just made my day

And I would do anything
Just to be with you
You share your love and everything
And I am sure its true
Cause every time youre here
I love you more my dear
Cause I felt this would never last, falling for you. hmmm hmmm hmmm
