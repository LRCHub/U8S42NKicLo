Hey girl in your summer blouse
Walking down the beach road from your house
How I'm thinking what to say to you
But I'm weak and stupid when I'm near you
Hey girl do you feel this night?
Now I know everything's going to be alright 'cause
I only ever think of you being down there
How I miss you

Summer airs smelling sweet
As you take me in a trance
From the noise and the people tonight
Now your hair's come undone
As we were walking I move closer
In the evening light
There's nothing I can do
'Cause I'm falling for you
Falling for you

Hey girl do you feel this night?
Now I know everything's going to be alright 'cause
I only ever think of you being down there
How I miss you

Summer airs smelling sweet
As you take me in a trance
From the noise and the people tonight
Now your hair's come undone
As we were walking I move closer
In the evening light
There's nothing I can do
'Cause I'm falling for you
Falling for you

Walking down the other day
You held my hand and asked
If I was feeling ok (Falling for you)
I wonder did you really mean something else
Do you feel how I am feeling myself? (Falling for you)
There's nothing I can do
'Cause I'm falling for you (I'm fallng for you)
Falling for you

(Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
I'm falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
I'm falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you)
